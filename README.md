# Dart Null Safety Error with '??' Operator

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Dart when using the null-aware operator `??` with nullable variables. The issue arises when the compiler incorrectly infers that a nullable variable might be null even when it's guaranteed to have a value within a specific code path.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code that reproduces the error. The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to correctly resolve the issue.

## Error Description

The code attempts to assign a value to an integer variable using the `??` operator. However, even if the variable is initialized and not null, the compiler might still throw an error because of the nullable type declaration.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the compiler understands that the variable cannot be null in that specific context.  This can often be achieved using explicit null checks or by refactoring the code to avoid unnecessary null checks.
